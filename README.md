# TURTROLER

a CC-TWEAKED turtle controller, server and turtle script




## Server

To deploy the websocket server run 

```bash
  node ./server/index.js
```
or simple run the included `startserver.py`

The ws package is needed for this server to run. You can either run
```bash
  npm install ws
```
or simply run the included `installdependencies.py`
## Web Client

The webclient can be accessed by simply opening the html file
## Turtle

The turtle program can be installed by running ```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PotatoGamo/ws-turtle-connector/main/turtroller.lua``` 
I recomend renaming this to startup.lua
